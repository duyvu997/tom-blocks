        Whatever happenned to art? Enough with the endless discord chat rooms,
        having to invite 20 people to get whitelisted and dealing with an army
        of people shilling their projects. We took a different stance from the
        start - a free, open, public mint on day 1. Art should be open and
        accesible to the masses.

        Each block is a uniquely crafted symbolic representation of the
        blockchain and comes with six attributes of varying rarities. There are
        three generations for a total of 1110 pieces starting with GEN 0, a
        limited edition of 10 pcs which will be followed by GEN 1 (100pcs) and
        GEN 2 (1000 pcs). Early adopters get rewarded with different perks. Each
        NFT is randomly distributed during the mint process.

        Your NFT doubles as a membership card and will grant you to benefits
        exclusive to the Lana Blocks community. We plan on starting out with a
        private members only community and then expanding into real life
        merchandise, exclusive NFT airdrops and future partnerships. This will
        be a member led community and our members will have the ability to
        propose and vote on future ideas for utility. We hope you are as excited
        to be on this journey as we are!
